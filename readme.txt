1. Create a directory for the application
 - go to the \Symbian\<Series 60 sdk dir>\epoc32\release\wins\udeb\z\system\apps directory
 - create a directory for the application: Mobomemory

2. copy the files in this zip file into this directory
 - move the mobomemeng.dll to the \Symbian\<Series 60 sdk dir>\epoc32\release\wins\udeb directory

3. launch the emulator
